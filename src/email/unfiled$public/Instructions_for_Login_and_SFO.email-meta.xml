Completing Salesforce Install:

The ‘Salesforce for Outlook’ icon below (1) will appear on your desktop. The ‘Walk Me Through’ box (2) below will automatically appear in the bottom right corner within the Salesforce browser.




































If you do not see the ‘Salesforce for Outlook’ icon on your desktop or the ‘Walk Me Through’ box in the bottom right corner of Salesforce within 24 hours reboot your computer and check again. If the problem persists, contact the Help Desk.


After you receive the updates you will need to manually complete the installation of Salesforce for Outlook. First access Salesforce at the following URL https://trade.my.salesforce.com.

Enter your email address (i.e. firstname.lastname@trade.gov) and ITA network password (same password used to login to your ITA computer). Upon successful login, you will be directed to the Salesforce Home page.
