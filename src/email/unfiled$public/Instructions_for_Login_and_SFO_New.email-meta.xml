    <subject>Welcome to the Salesforce Customer Relationship Management System</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear CRM User,

To ensure you have access to the full functionality of ITA&apos;s Salesforce CRM, please read this entire email and follow all instructions in the referenced documents.  If you experience any difficulty, contact the Help Desk for assistance: 1-877-206-0645 or CSC@trade.gov.

Note:  As part of the CRM system&apos;s &quot;Soft-Launch&quot;, you will now be able to work with your organizations, contacts and activities; and also review case and WIN records.  The CRM Team is currently working on cleaning up migrated case and WIN data. Additionally, the Data Team will be cleaning Organization records and reducing duplicates.  Thank you for your patience.

Logging Into Salesforce:
You can access Salesforce at the following URL: https://trade.my.salesforce.com.   Enter your email address (i.e. firstname.lastname@trade.gov) and ITA network password (same password used to login to your ITA computer). Upon successful login, you will be directed to the Salesforce Home page.  You now have the ability to take advantage of the new CRM Tool.


Installing Salesforce Plug-Ins:
The day your Salesforce account is activated and you have received this welcome letter, the following two applications will be pushed to your ITA Computer: WalkMe Tutorials and Salesforce for Outlook. (Note:  The Salesforce for Outlook plug-in is an enhancement tool. If you don’t install it, you can still access and use Salesforce.)

Walk Me will install automatically and the &apos;Walk Me Through&apos; box, shown at the bottom of the email (1), will appear in the bottom right corner within Salesforce.

As for the Salesforce for Outlook plug-in, you will need to manually complete the installation.   Click on the Salesforce for Outlook Installation Instructions located under the Help &amp; Stuff tab (2). After you have successfully installed the &apos;Salesforce for Outlook&apos; plug-in, the icon (3) will appear on your desktop.

If you do not see &apos;Walk Me Through&apos; box in the bottom right corner of Salesforce within 24 hours reboot your computer.  If you still do not see it, or if you have issues installing the Salesforce for Outlook plug-in, contact the Help Desk.
