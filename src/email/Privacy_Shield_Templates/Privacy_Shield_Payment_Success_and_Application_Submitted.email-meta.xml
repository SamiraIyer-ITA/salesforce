    <textOnly>Dear {!Payment__c.OwnerFirstName} {!Payment__c.OwnerLastName},

Thank you for your organization’s interest in self-certifying its adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles. The Privacy Shield team at the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration (ITA) has received your organization’s self-certification application, as well as payment of the processing fee, and will review your organization’s self-certification application in a timely manner. Please note that the processing time will depend on the completeness of the self-certification application and the volume of self-certification applications received.


As the designated representative of your organization, you will be notified by e-mail regarding the status of the self-certification. You will receive either:

*Confirmation that your organization’s self-certification has been finalized; or

*A request for additional information to complete the review of your organization’s self-certification application or revisions to materials relevant to the self-certification, such as the applicable privacy policy statement(s).


When an organization’s self-certification has been finalized, the organization is placed on the authoritative Privacy Shield List maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Privacy Shield List is made available to the public on the Privacy Shield website: https://www.privacyshield.gov/. Privacy Shield benefits are assured from the date that the Department places an organization on the Privacy Shield List.





Thank you for your cooperation.</textOnly>
