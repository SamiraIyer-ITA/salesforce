The Privacy Shield List is updated on the basis of annual re-certification submissions, and notifications received pursuant to the Supplemental Principle on Dispute Resolution and Enforcement. Re-certification submissions must be provided not less than annually; otherwise the organization will be removed from the Privacy Shield List and Privacy Shield benefits will no longer be assured.</font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">An organization's removal from the Privacy Shield List means it may no longer benefit from the European Commission's adequacy decision to receive personal information from the EU. The organization must continue to apply the Privacy Shield Principles to the personal information it received while it participated in the Privacy Shield, and affirm to the Department on an annual basis its commitment to do so, for as long as it retains such information; otherwise, the organization must return or delete the information or provide "adequate" protection for the information by another authorized means. Removal from the Privacy Shield List means that such organizations cannot claim to be Privacy Shield compliant and must avoid any statements or misleading practices implying that they participate in the Privacy Shield; and that such organizations are no longer entitled to benefit from the European Commission's adequacy decision that would enable those organizations to receive personal information from the EU. An organization that continues to claim participation in the Privacy Shield or makes other Privacy Shield-related misrepresentations after it has been removed from the Privacy Shield List may be subject to enforcement action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Transportation, or other enforcement authorities.</font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"></p><p style="font-size: medium;"></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>ANNUAL PRIVACY SHIELD PROCESSING FEE</b></font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Please note that there is a nonrefundable, annual processing fee that an organization must remit to the Department in order to self-certify the organization’s adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles. The funds collected through this fee are used to help defray the costs associated with administering the Privacy Shield program. Payment, which must accompany the annual self-certification submission, may be made by credit card or by ACH (Automatic Clearing House). The specific amount a given organization will be charged will be determined according to a sliding scale based on the organization’s annual revenue.</font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Privacy Shield Fee Schedule:</font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Organization’s Annual Revenue <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>Annual Fee</font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Under $5,000,000 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">				</span>$350</font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">$5,000,000 - $25,000,000 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>$550</font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">$25,000,001 - $100,000,000 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>$750</font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Over $100,000,000 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">				</span>$950</font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"></p><p style="font-size: medium;"></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>USE OF EU DPAs FOR PRIVACY SHIELD-RELATED DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b></font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b><br></b></font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">If your organization wishes its Privacy Shield benefits to cover human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship, it must commit to cooperate with the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to such data (See Supplemental Principle on Human Resources Data). Even if your organization does not wish its Privacy Shield benefits to cover human resources data, it may nevertheless commit to cooperate with the EU DPAs with regard to other types of personal data covered under its self-certification.

Any misrepresentation to the general public concerning an organization's adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles may be actionable by the FTC or other relevant government body. The FTC has the power to rectify such misrepresentations by seeking administrative orders and civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day for violations of those orders. Misrepresentations to the Department may be actionable under the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. § 1001).</font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></p><p style="font-size: medium;"></p><p style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">If your organization has any questions concerning the re-certification process, please contact the ITA at privacyshield@trade.gov.</font></p>]]></td>
