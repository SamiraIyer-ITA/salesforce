    <textOnly>PRIVACY SHIELD RE-CERTIFICATION FOLLOW-UP REMINDER


Our records indicate that the original Privacy Shield self-certification for {!Asset.Account} was finalized on {!Asset.InstallDate}.


The U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration (ITA) would once again like to invite your organization to re-certify its adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles, including the Supplemental Principles or confirm that your organization wishes to withdraw from the Privacy Shield program administered by the Department. Instructions on how to re-certify are available on the Privacy Shield website at: https://www.privacyshield.gov.


ANNUAL PRIVACY SHIELD RE-CERTIFICATION


The Department maintains and makes available to the public an authoritative list of U.S. organizations that file completed self-certification submissions to the Department and declare their commitment to adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles (&quot;the Privacy Shield List&quot;), thereby assuring the availability of Privacy Shield benefits to said organizations. The Privacy Shield List is updated on the basis of annual re-certification submissions, and notifications received pursuant to the Supplemental Principle on Dispute Resolution and Enforcement. Re-certification submissions must be provided not less than annually; otherwise the organization will be removed from the Privacy Shield List and Privacy Shield benefits will no longer be assured.


An organization&apos;s removal from the Privacy Shield List means it may no longer benefit from the European Commission&apos;s adequacy decision to receive personal information from the EU. The organization must continue to apply the Privacy Shield Principles to the personal information it received while it participated in the Privacy Shield, and affirm to the Department on an annual basis its commitment to do so, for as long as it retains such information; otherwise, the organization must return or delete the information or provide &quot;adequate&quot; protection for the information by another authorized means. Removal from the Privacy Shield List means that such organizations cannot claim to be Privacy Shield compliant and must avoid any statements or misleading practices implying that they participate in the Privacy Shield; and that such organizations are no longer entitled to benefit from the European Commission&apos;s adequacy decision that would enable those organizations to receive personal information from the EU. An organization that continues to claim participation in the Privacy Shield or makes other Privacy Shield-related misrepresentations after it has been removed from the Privacy Shield List may be subject to enforcement action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Transportation, or other enforcement authorities.


ANNUAL PRIVACY SHIELD PROCESSING FEE

Please note that there is a nonrefundable, annual processing fee that an organization must remit to the Department in order to self-certify the organization’s adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles. The funds collected through this fee are used to help defray the costs associated with administering the Privacy Shield program. Payment, which must accompany the annual self-certification submission, may be made by credit card or by ACH (Automatic Clearing House). The specific amount a given organization will be charged will be determined according to a sliding scale based on the organization’s annual revenue.


Privacy Shield Fee Schedule:

Organization’s Annual Revenue  Annual Fee

Under $5,000,000  $350

$5,000,000 - $25,000,000  $550

$25,000,001 - $100,000,000  $750

Over $100,000,000  $950



USE OF EU DPAs FOR PRIVACY SHIELD-RELATED DISPUTE RESOLUTION

If your organization wishes its Privacy Shield benefits to cover human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship, it must commit to cooperate with the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to such data (See Supplemental Principle on Human Resources Data). Even if your organization does not wish its Privacy Shield benefits to cover human resources data, it may nevertheless commit to cooperate with the EU DPAs with regard to other types of personal data covered under its self-certification. For additional information regarding the role of the EU DPAs in Privacy Shield-related dispute resolution, please see the Supplemental Principle on the Role of the Data Protection Authorities.

Please note that if your organization is either required to use the EU DPAs (i.e., with regard to human resources data) or has chosen to use the EU DPAs to resolve complaints concerning personal data covered by your organization’s self-certification, it must pay an annual fee of $__.__ to cover the operating costs of the EU DPAs&apos; panel. This fee is payable to the ______________, which has agreed to act as trusted third party for this purpose. If your organization requires further information on how to carry out the payment, please see: ______________.


PRIVACY SHIELD ENFORCEMENT

An organization&apos;s failure to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles is enforceable under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts in or affecting commerce (15 U.S.C. § 45(a)) or other laws or regulations prohibiting such acts. Any misrepresentation to the general public concerning an organization&apos;s adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles may be actionable by the FTC or other relevant government body. The FTC has the power to rectify such misrepresentations by seeking administrative orders and civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day for violations of those orders. Misrepresentations to the Department may be actionable under the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. § 1001).
